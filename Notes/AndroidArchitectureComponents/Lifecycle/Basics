Lifecycle Aware Components:

1.  Lifecycle aware components do things when there is change in lifecycle of another
    component(This could be an Activity/Fragment).
2.  Usually when we want to perform an action on a component during change in Activity/Fragments
    lifecycle we write the code in onCreate() onResume() etc. This makes the activities bulky handles
    more error prone.
3.  Sometimes we create a separate class for components that need to be lifecycle aware and call
    its methods using an object in activity's or fragment's lifecycle methods. The problem here is
    sometimes these method calls take longer than activity lifecycle method call lasts.
    **Solution:
4.  android.arch.Lifecycle package provides classes and interfaces that let you build Lifecycle
    aware components.
5.  Most of the components on Lifecycle package have lifecycles attached to them. Lifecycles aware
    managed by android.
