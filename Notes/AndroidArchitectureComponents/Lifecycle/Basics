Lifecycle Aware Components:

1.  Lifecycle aware components do things when there is change in lifecycle of another
    component(This could be an Activity/Fragment).
2.  Usually when we want to perform an action on a component during change in Activity/Fragments
    lifecycle we write the code in onCreate() onResume() etc. This makes the activities bulky handles
    more error prone.
3.  android.arch.Lifecycle package provides classes and interfaces that let you build Lifecycle
    aware components.
4.  Most of the components on Lifecycle package have lifecycles attached to them. Lifecycles aware
    managed by android.
