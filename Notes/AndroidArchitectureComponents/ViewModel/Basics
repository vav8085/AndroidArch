ViewModel

1.  Viewmodel prepares data for Activity and Fragments.
2.  Viewmodel also handles communication of activity and Fragments with rest of application.
3.  Viewmodels life is as long as the the scope(Activity/Fragment) its attached to.
4.  Viewmodel does not get destroyed as long as activity is not finished. If an activity
    is destroyed during a configuration change when its new instance gets created it
    gets attached with viewmodel again.
5.  Viewmodel keeps the data for activity or fragment.
6.  Activities/Fragments communicate with Viewmodel using Livedata or Rxjava or Otto etc.
7.  Viewmodel does not hold any reference to activity / fragment.
