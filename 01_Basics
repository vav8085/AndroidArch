Refactoring code:
1.  If a method or an object is doing more than one thing then it needs refactoring.
2.  To refactor an object we usually split it into smaller and more specific objects.
3.  To refactor methods we use Extract Method refactoring. -- This is opposite of inline methods
    The method should only do what is does, We can create submethods that say how to do it.
4.  Create abstract methods if there are multiple implementations possible for different scenarios.
    Like method to fetch an employee number from a Map of employees or from a database or from a list. All
    the scenarios will have different implementation, creating an abstract method instead of if and else will
    developers to extend these to future scenarios as well.
5.  Reduced duplication, high expressiveness and early building of simple abstraction makes the code clean.

*   Leave the code cleaner than you found it.
